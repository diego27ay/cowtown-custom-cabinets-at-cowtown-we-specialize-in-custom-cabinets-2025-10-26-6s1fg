                            Payment terms will be outlined in your specific service agreement or contract. Typically, we require a deposit to begin the design and fabrication process, with additional payments due at various stages of the project, and final payment due upon completion and installation. All payments must be made in full before final installation unless other arrangements have been approved in writing. We accept cash, check, credit card, and electronic transfers.

                            Cancellation policies will be detailed in your service agreement. Generally, if you cancel a project after fabrication has begun, you may be responsible for costs incurred up to that point. Custom-fabricated cabinets are non-refundable once production has commenced. Refunds for cancellations made before fabrication begins may be subject to a cancellation fee. Any refunds will be processed within 14 business days of approval.
